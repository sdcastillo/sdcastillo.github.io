Discovering the Magic of Slow Travel in Vermont
I’ve fallen completely in love with the way I travel these days: booking a cozy VRBO or VRBO as my home base, renting a car through Turo so I’m free to roam on my own schedule, and then just… letting the days unfold. No rigid itineraries, no tour buses—just me, a comfy house (often with a kitchen and a porch), a set of keys to some stranger’s Subaru, and the open road. This style of exploring the U.S. has become my absolute favorite way to feel the heartbeat of a place. You live like a local for a week or two, cook a couple of meals, discover the backroads nobody posts about, and suddenly the whole country feels more accessible and real.
Vermont was the perfect example of why this works so beautifully.
Why I Love Staying in VRBOs and VRBOs

You get space to spread out—way more comfortable than a hotel room.
Full kitchens mean I can hit the local farmer’s market or country store and actually cook with Vermont cheddar and fresh maple syrup.
That “lived-in” feeling: rocking chairs on the porch, a stack of board games, maybe even a fire pit. It turns a trip into a home.
You’re usually a little outside the main tourist zones, which is exactly where the magic hides.

Why Renting a Car on Turo is a Game-Changer

Pick the exact car you want (AWD for mountain roads? Done).
No lines at the rental counter, no surprise fees—just unlock it with your phone and go.
Way cheaper than traditional rentals, especially for longer trips.
You feel like you borrowed a friend’s car instead of driving something that smells like a thousand strangers.

That Perfect Vermont Morning
One of my favorite memories was rolling out of my VRBO, still in that delicious vacation haze, and heading to Back Country Café. I ordered cream cheese and cinnamon toast (yes, for breakfast—no judgment) paired with a rich local beer. Sat outside in the crisp mountain air while the world woke up slowly around me. Nobody rushing, nobody checking the time. Just birds, coffee, and the smell of toast on the breeze. That’s the kind of moment you can’t manufacture in a hotel lobby.
Why Vermont Just… Works
Vermont has this rare superpower: it feels both rugged and welcoming at the same time. One minute you’re winding through the Green Mountains on a dirt road surrounded by nothing but trees, the next you pull into a tiny town with a killer diner or brewery. Maple creemee stands, covered bridges, farm stores selling cheese older than most states—it’s all right there. You can be five minutes from a café and still feel deliciously lost in the backcountry.
Those quiet Vermont days built themselves around the simplest, best things:

Sleepy small-town mornings
A lazy breakfast that lingers
A good beer in the afternoon sun
A spontaneous drive or hike through the hills

That’s it. That’s the whole recipe.
This style of travel—VRBO + Turo + new trails every day—has completely changed how I see the U.S. It’s slower, deeper, and way more rewarding. Vermont reminded me that sometimes the best adventures aren’t about checking boxes… they’re about cinnamon toast, porch swings, and letting the mountains tell you where to go next.
