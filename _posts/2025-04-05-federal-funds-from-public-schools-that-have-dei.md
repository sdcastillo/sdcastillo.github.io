The Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal funds from public schools that have diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

In a letter to state leaders across the country, the U.S. Education Department said Title I funding, which is targeted to schools with a high proportion of low income students, would be threatened if schools failed to follow its interpretation of civil rights laws.

Any violation of civil rights law, it says, "including the use of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion ('DEI') programs to advantage one's race over another—is impermissible."

School and state officials are required to sign a certification letter attached to the memo and return it to the department within 10 days, proving that they are complying with the directive.
