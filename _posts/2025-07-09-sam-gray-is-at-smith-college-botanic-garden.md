WARM TEMPERATE
HOUSE
Built in 1895
Warm Temperate House holds groups of warm-growing plants that require higher light levels than those in Palm House. Many of our tropical aroids—Araceae family-can be found here, identifiable by their spathe and spadix floral structure. This family includes the corpse flower, Amorphophallus titanum, and our native jack-in-the-pulpit and skunk cabbage. Along with the aroids, Warm Temperate House showcases many representatives of the African violet family-Gesneriaceae-with their bright and showy flowers that make them popular houseplants. At the west end of Warm Temperate House sits a small pond divided into sections holding different species of aquatic plants, accompanied by scrambling carnivorous pitcher plants-Nepenthes— from southeast Asia hanging overhead, and epiphytic ant plants-Myrmecodia and Hydnophytum—displayed
around its perimeter. These plants the aquatic,
carnivorous and epiphytic-are examples of some of the unique morphological and physiological adaptations in the plant kingdom.
The physical nature of this space, with its low ceiling and long southern exposure, makes Warm Temperate House an intensely bright and hot growing environment, particularly in the summertime. Because most plants here are herbaceous
perennials, they must be continuously tended, contained, and renewed, making the Warm Temperate community extremely dynamic in its own way. Plants here grow to fill all the available space from spring through summer and then are drastically pruned in fall and winter to open room up for the next year's growth. That's why this house can feel so different from one season to the next.

The Smith College Botanical Garden holds a special place in my heart, and I have been a frequent visitor there since I was young.  #botanical #plants #garden #smithcollege
