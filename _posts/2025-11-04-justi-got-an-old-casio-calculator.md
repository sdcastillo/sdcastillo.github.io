Justi got an old Casio calculator,.  It's fascinating to see the old tech that still works!  
Isn't it amazing to think that we went to the moon using slide rules and essentially Arduinos...?


I marvel at printers and composing in Word because I remember the poor quality of spirit duplicators and the work involved in making masters for mimeograph. You have no idea what it was like to write papers on manual typewriters and planning to leave room for footnotes and correcting errors, etc. Anyone can make beautiful documents today with illustrations, different fonts, charts, etc. What a wonderful world of technology!
