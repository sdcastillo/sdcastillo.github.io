I am grateful for being employed by Expedia, and they valued my contributions while working from November 2022 for a year.  To name a few:

- Helping to create the France annual data sharing report
- Testing the Spanish authorities API to pull cadastral reference numbers
- Testing automation of validating Norway addresses through the use of an API
- Gathering and preparing DAC-7 requirements to build queries and analyze existing partner information
- Spearheaded the analysis of financial transactions with a gross booked value in the trillions, ensuring stringent data integrity for customer bank details.
- Implemented rigorous validation processes for high-frequency financial transactions, achieving 100% accuracy in reporting and compliance.
- Optimized payment processing systems using AI-enhanced Python scripts, halving query runtime and enhancing transactional efficiency.
- Created dynamic Tableau visualizations for travel data, facilitating real-time decision-making and global geo-location insights.
