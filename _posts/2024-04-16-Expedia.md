I am grateful for being employed by Expedia, and they valued my contributions while working from November 2022 for a year.  To name a few:

- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis for regulatory specifications.
- Developed Github CoPilot Python scripts using AI to lower query runtime by nearly 50% 
- Maintained data standards, policies, and procedures for data mining and data warehousing programs
- Designed applications integrating data from several disparate sources
- Provided a unified view of the data with Tableau and Excel Sheets
- Analyzed and defining data requirements and specifications
- Managed anticipated changes in enterprise data capacity requirements
