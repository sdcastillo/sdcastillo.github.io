Thanksgiving holds a special place in American history as one of our nation's most cherished holidays. As I reflect on this season, I find myself thinking about the deeper meaning behind the meal we gather to share—a meal that began centuries ago as a symbol of peace and mutual respect.

## The History: A Shared Meal of Peace

The first Thanksgiving, as many of us learn in school, was celebrated when the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag Native Americans came together to share a harvest meal. This historic event, occurring in 1621, represented something remarkable: a moment of cooperation and peaceful coexistence between two very different cultures.

What made this gathering significant was not just the food on the table, but what it symbolized. The Pilgrims, who had arrived in the New World with limited knowledge of how to survive in this new land, benefited from the agricultural wisdom and generosity of the Native Americans. The Wampanoag people shared their knowledge of cultivation and hunting, and together they celebrated their successful harvest.

This meal was more than sustenance—it was a declaration of peace, a recognition of shared humanity, and gratitude for the abundance they had secured through their combined efforts. Whether we acknowledge all aspects of this history or not, the ideal of Thanksgiving as a peaceful gathering around a shared meal remains at the heart of the holiday.

## New England Roots: Where Thanksgiving Lives On

Growing up in New England, Thanksgiving wasn't just a holiday marked on the calendar—it was woven into the very fabric of our community. New England, the birthplace of this American tradition, maintains a deep reverence for Thanksgiving that feels different from anywhere else.

In my childhood home, Thanksgiving was treated with a sacred quality. The holiday represented more than a meal; it represented our connection to history, to place, and to family. The autumn leaves painted the New England landscape in brilliant reds and golds, and as the harvest season concluded, we would gather around the table with the understanding that we were participating in a tradition that had defined our region for over four centuries.

The New England celebration of Thanksgiving carries with it a sense of historical awareness. When you grow up in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, or any of the northeastern states, you're literally living where this story unfolded. That proximity to history makes the holiday feel more real, more meaningful. We didn't just read about the Pilgrims and Native Americans—we walked on the same ground where they had walked.

## A Tradition of Gratitude

Whether gathered with family in a New England farmhouse or elsewhere across the country, Thanksgiving remains a powerful reminder of what we value: gratitude, community, and the importance of sharing a meal with those we cherish.

As we approach this Thanksgiving season, I encourage everyone to remember not just the food and festivities, but the original spirit of the holiday—a gathering to express appreciation for what we have and recognition of the people who made it possible.

Happy Thanksgiving to all, wherever your roots may be.
