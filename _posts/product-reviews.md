The last year I have been fortunate to have test flown many great applications.  These are the ones which have worked out well, that have added to productivity, and that are still being used by our team today. 

- Grok - Is very valuable, as the phrase "grok it" comes to mean getting sh**t done fast and efficiently, not dotting every i and crossing every T, but making things move forward.  The new features of how Grok updates my X feed, is really amazing. So even when I am posting on X it is updating the preferences of Grok.  The features are comparable to the other platforms, models that allow uploading files. The Image to Video feature of Imagine is fantastic, making movie-like scenes from pictures.  

- Notion.ai, is fantastic for keeping track of notes, calendar, meeting recordings.  This is essentially Microsoft OneNote that used to be, or Apple Notes, though this helps solve the problem that all of these systems are separated out.  And the best feature is the "chat with documents" and so all of work gets combined together.  Though its a bit pricey, it is big time-saver

- Chat GPT.  Yes, I joined chat GPT Plus soon after it launched, and kept the Plus subscription for two years.  I remember how big an improvement it was going from 3.5 to 4, and then when 4o launched this was another big leap forward.  I think that using chatGPT and having too many filters, or restricted outputs, the guardrails are not really getting us the types of answers needed; and also heard o ftoo many people making "chat GPT detection" apps.  And so using different chat features mixed up the setup.

- Perplexity AI - better for cyber security, and was a wrapper on the chatGPT and other models (claude, R1, etc) which keeps more of the good models in one platform

- Meta AI - Have not used often, except for when posting on Facebook occasionally rewriting post using Meta AI.  

- Apple Intelligence - Very practical for use with the iphone.  After being part of the Beta program last year, once the new IOS 26 rolled out and made all features universal across the operating system, this was really practical.  Considering it comes free with the iPhone is a great value.
