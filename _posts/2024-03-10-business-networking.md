A great networking event! Talked about technology, chatGPT, and innovation! 
 

From the Round Rock Chamber on LinkedIn: 
 
“Thank you to everyone who helped us kick-off the new year by attending our Dell for Startups + Round Rock Chamber Startup Ecosystem happy hour last Thursday! 🎉 We were able to share all of our exciting plans for the upcoming year and experience the latest Dell Technologies products on the Dell XPS Truck. Our friends at Dell for Startups also surprised us with a special announcement. The Round Rock Chamber was awarded the Dell for Startups 2023 Partner Recognition! 🏆 Collaboration is made so easy with partners like YJ Lin and Marcus DeVane! 🤝”
