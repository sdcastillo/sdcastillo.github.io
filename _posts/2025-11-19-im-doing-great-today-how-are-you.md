I'm doing great today!  How are you?  At 20, I moved out with more determination than furniture. First stop: Boston. That city taught me grit, curiosity, and what community looks like when neighbors show up for each other. A few years later, an amazing job opportunity whisked me to Chicago—different skyline, same lesson: cities are living, breathing communities built by people who participate.  Living in these places changed me. Civic duty stopped being abstract and became daily actions: voting in every election (big and small), showing up to local meetings, volunteering, supporting local businesses, checking on neighbors, and picking up trash instead of stepping over it. None of it is glamorous, all of it matters.  It was amazing leaders, friends, coworkers, and strangers who opened doors and pulled up chairs along the way. If you’ve been wondering how to get involved where you live, consider this your sign to show up. Your block, your ward, your town gets better when you do.
