Representing my Expedia team tshirt.  
I first began working on Expedia in 2018-2019, they were a client of my actuarial firm.  Then in 2023 as a contractor.
HomeAway was founded in 2005 (9 years after Vrbo and 3 years before Airbnb). HomeAway bought Vrbo in 2006, then Expedia Group acquired HomeAway in 2015.
