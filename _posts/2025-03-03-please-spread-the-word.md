PLEASE spread the word where you can !!!! There is a sign up at the Cook Ave trailhead kiosk that states on July 26 three dogs were attacked - one was bitten by a bear . While this is awful .. I'm questioning WERE the dogs OFF leash? This is a serious issue and people need to leash their dogs, especially in this area with a mom and 3 cubs .. please ! This is a human problem . Momma bear is just protecting her family!! If anyone is on Northampton FB pages could you post this .. 🙏
