Enjoyed a great chat today about some favorite Northampton spots like Woodstar Café and Forbes Library, and reflecting on how our town’s culture is evolving. It really made me think about the ways we can support strong values and community ideals as Northampton grows and changes. Grateful to be part of such a thoughtful and vibrant place! #NorthamptonMA #Community #LocalLife
