# Travel
Traveling to hike new trails, walk green city parks, and play golf on different courses has become a running theme in your life. You keep ending up in places where there is a mix of open “cow country,” nearby mountains, and water to skate on when winter finally settles in.​

**Boise and green spaces!**
Boise, Idaho fits that vibe really well, with its mix of sagebrush plains, ranch country, and the Boise Mountains rising just to the north, giving you easy access to hiking and open views. The city’s parks and greenbelt along the river make it easy to go for long walks in green spaces and bring a dog along, even though you are never far from those wide, dry hills that feel like real cow country.​

**Lakes and winter skating**
On the Great Lakes side, Michigan and the surrounding region give you a different kind of adventure, with frozen lakes and ponds where you can go ice skating once the temperatures stay low long enough for solid ice. Skating outside, surrounded by snow-covered trees and a huge, cold horizon of ice and water, fits that love of winter landscapes even when the air itself is harsher than you really enjoy.​

**Loving snow, not the cold** ⛷️⛄
You do not actually like feeling cold, but you keep traveling back to snowy places because the visuals and the atmosphere are worth it to you. Walking a dog through quiet, snow-covered parks or hiking on packed winter trails lets you enjoy the snow as a texture and a sound, even if you are bundled up and ready to get back inside afterward. Golf, hiking, and those winter skating sessions all end up being different ways of doing the same thing: moving your body through new landscapes and letting each place leave its own mental snapshot
