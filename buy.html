      This course was the piece (in my opinion) that pushed me over the finish line, and I can’t express how grateful I am that it was there when I needed it. I will definitely recommend it to anyone I know looking to prepare for Exam PA.

      The SOA modules do not prepare you for this exam. Sam’s course helped me to pass even though I started it pretty late. I only purchased the course on October 28th and sat for the exam on December 7th (preferably leave yourself more time). I passed with a 7. I actually thought the SOA modules and examples would get me there. When I got near the end of the modules I realized how underprepared I was and signed up for Sam’s course. The course tells you what you need to know and how to effectively study for the exam. It has a clear schedule. The way he teaches, writes, and explains things is easy to understand.

      I almost exclusively used ExamPA.net for studying for PA, and I basically crammed it all in two days and I got an 8!

      I found that with its focus on hands-on training, the course delivers a significant boost to meeting all the learning requirements for the PA exam.

      Buy 👏 this 👏 course 👏 This course is the reason I passed in December. I wouldn't have been able to prepare at all on my own, and I wouldn't have even been willing to try and sit for the December exam if it weren't this product. I passed after only studying for 2.5 months because Sam is really that good.

      The videos really helped my understanding of topics, especially being able to hear the thought process while doing a question. Also, the tips on exam setting and how to save time were really helpful.

      The time savings tip is really helpful especially when you write the Executive Summary towards the end of the exam. The video lesson on past SOA exams and solutions and new practice exams are great too. If the forum participation can be more active with more members, then that will be better for all. Thanks. Passed the PA exam with an 8 in June 2020.
