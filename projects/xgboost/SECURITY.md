# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Welcome, Security Researchers!

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities in my projects. I deeply appreciate the work of security researchers and the open-source community who help make software safer for everyone.  Pleaes report security issues to "ArtificialActuary@gmail.com"

This security policy outlines how to report vulnerabilities and what to expect from me throughout the process.

## 🎯 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of my GitHub projects, I want to hear about it—but **please do so responsibly**.

### How to Report

**Do NOT:**
- ❌ Create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability
- ❌ Post details on social media or public forums
- ❌ Publicly shame or pressure for a fix

**Do:**
- ✅ Report privately through GitHub's Security Advisory feature
- ✅ Email me directly at: **[Your Email]** (if you prefer)
- ✅ Include as much detail as possible
- ✅ Give me reasonable time to respond and patch

### Private Reporting via GitHub

**For GitHub repositories, use GitHub's Private Vulnerability Disclosure:**

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill out the form with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
   - Your contact information

**This creates a private security advisory that only you and I can see until we're ready to publish.**

### Direct Email

If you prefer email or GitHub's system isn't working:
- **Email:** [Your Email Address]
- **Subject Line:** `[SECURITY] Vulnerability in [Project Name]`
- **Include:**
  - Detailed vulnerability description
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact
  - Your name (optional, but appreciated)
  - How you'd like to be credited (optional)

## ⏱️ What to Expect

### Response Timeline

  - I will investigate the vulnerability
  - Verify the issue
  - Develop a fix
  - Test the fix thoroughly

- **Patch Release:** After investigation

  - Create a security advisory
  - Credit the reporter (unless you prefer anonymity)

## 🙏 Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

I follow responsible disclosure best practices and expect the same from reporters:

1. **Confidentiality** - Keep vulnerability details confidential until patched and disclosed
2. **Good Faith** - Only test the vulnerability on systems you own or have permission to test
3. **No Exploitation** - Do not access, modify, or delete data beyond what's needed to prove the vulnerability
4. **No Disruption** - Do not disrupt service availability or performance
5. **Patience** - Give me reasonable time to investigate and patch

## 🏆 Recognition & Credit

**I will gladly credit you for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities**, including:

- Your name (if you want it public)
- Your website or social media
- A link to your GitHub profile
- In the security advisory
- In the release notes

**If you prefer anonymity,** that's completely fine—just let me know.

## 📜 Legal

**Safe Harbor:** If you follow this security policy in good faith, I will not pursue legal action against you, including under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) or similar laws.

You will not be held liable for:
- Testing vulnerabilities on systems you own or have permission to test
- Accessing or modifying data only to the extent necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Temporarily affecting system availability during testing (if done responsibly)

**Limitations:**
- Testing must be limited to the project(s) in scope
- Do not access or modify data belonging to other users or projects
- Do not test on production systems without explicit permission
