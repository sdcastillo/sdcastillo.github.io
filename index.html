    <h1>Quantum Computing: Data-Driven Insights for Unbreakable Code.</h1>
    <p>Quantum physics is the branch of physics that explains the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. It introduces ideas like superposition (a system being in multiple states at once), entanglement (strong correlations between distant systems), and measurement that probabilistically collapses possibilities into outcomes. These principles, encoded in wavefunctions and operators, underlie technologies from lasers and semiconductors to emerging quantum computers that process information in fundamentally new ways.</p>

    <h2>Why the first humans to build powerful quantum machines could "get all the Bitcoin"</h2>
    <p>Bitcoin’s security today relies heavily on elliptic‑curve digital signatures (ECDSA over secp256k1). A sufficiently large, fault‑tolerant quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could, in principle, derive a private key from its corresponding public key (or from a signature) in practical time. That would let an attacker authorize transfers for any coins whose public keys have been revealed—e.g., legacy P2PK outputs, reused addresses, many exchange hot wallets, and any transaction as soon as it appears in the mempool. By racing the network with a higher‑fee, conflicting transaction, such an attacker could sweep funds before honest confirmations land. While “all the Bitcoin” is hype—coins whose public keys remain unknown (hashed-only addresses) are safer until they are spent, and the network can migrate to post‑quantum signatures—the first mover with a capable quantum machine would have a dramatic, short‑term asymmetric advantage to steal a vast amount of coins and disrupt the ecosystem.</p>
