**Ode to Generalized Linear Models**

In the garden of statistics, under the sky so broad,
Lies a framework so robust, a mathematical god,
Generalized Linear Models, in splendor they stand,
Uniting the discrete and continuous across the land.

With a link function's grace, they connect and convert,
The expected mean of response, in a way that's overt,
Whether Poisson, binomial, or normal, it's clear,
GLMs bring the data's story near.

Predicting outcomes with a distribution's eye,
They capture the essence of the data's reply,
Through maximum likelihood, they find the way,
To shine a light where the predictors lay.

Linear in parameters, yet so versatile,
They handle data that's binary with a gentle smile,
For every trial and count, for each scale and rate,
GLMs articulate the patterns innate.

So here's to the GLMs, in their elegant dance,
In the vast field of data, they advance,
A statistical tool, both powerful and prime,
For the analysis of data, they're truly sublime.
