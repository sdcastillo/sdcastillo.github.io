    <h1>Actuarial Exams Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      This project analyzes my own exam results and practice data from the Coaching Actuaries
      Adapt engine. The content below is rendered from the file
      <code>Actuarial_Exams.html</code> in this repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work was done with consent and coordination with Coaching Actuaries staff, including
      Ben Kester, who was employed at Coaching Actuaries at the time. All data shown here comes
      exclusively from my own usage of Adapt; it does not include data from any other Adapt users.
      I wrote all of the R code for this project myself, and I personally answered every Adapt
      question represented in this dataset.
