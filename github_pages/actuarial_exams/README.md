This project and its associated article were created with the knowledge and consent of Coaching Actuaries staff, specifically with the involvement of Ben Kester, who was employed at Coaching Actuaries at the time. All data analyzed here comes exclusively from my own usage of the Adapt engine and reflects only my personal exam and practice history, not data from any other Adapt users. I wrote all of the R code in this repository myself, without assistance from others, and I personally answered every Adapt question represented in this dataset
