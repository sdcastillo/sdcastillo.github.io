# is QFS worthwhile

Well, if you’re asking me about QFS—though I assume you mean the so-called “Quantum Financial System” that’s been making the rounds in some circles—I’d advise you to apply the same filter I’ve used for decades: focus on what’s understandable, productive, and rooted in reality.

Let’s break it down in the style I’ve used in my annual letters:

## **1. Stick to What You Understand**

Charlie and I have always said: “Never invest in a business you cannot understand”[^1]. If someone is pitching you a financial system based on quantum mechanics, blockchain, or promises of overnight riches, ask yourself: *Do I truly understand how this works?* If the answer is no, you’re better off passing. The world is full of investments you can understand—why venture into the fog?

## **2. Look for Productive Assets**

Over the years, the investments that have served Berkshire and its shareholders best are those rooted in productive assets—businesses that generate cash, have durable competitive advantages, and are run by trustworthy managers[^1][^2]. If QFS is being sold as a speculative vehicle, or if it promises to “revolutionize” finance without clear, tangible value creation, I’d be skeptical. Remember, “Wall Street loves the fees that deal-making generates, and the press loves the stories that colorful promoters provide”[^3].

## **3. Avoid the Siren Song of Complexity and Hype**

History is littered with investment schemes that dazzled with jargon and technology but left investors empty-handed. As I’ve written, “At such times, whatever foolishness can be marketed will be vigorously marketed—not by everyone but always by someone”[^1]. If QFS is being promoted with grand promises but lacks transparency, track record, or regulatory clarity, steer clear.

## **4. Beware of Permanent Loss of Capital**

My cardinal rule: *Never risk permanent loss of capital*[^1]. If you can’t verify the safety, legality, and utility of QFS, you’re exposing yourself to risks you can’t control or even quantify.

## **5. The Power of Inaction**

Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing at all. “When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable”[^1]. If you already own productive assets, don’t let the allure of the new and untested distract you.

> “In the short run the market acts as a voting machine—in the long run it becomes a weighing machine.” — Ben Graham, as I’ve often quoted[^1].

## **Bottom Line**

If QFS can’t show you a clear, understandable, and productive path to value—one that you can explain to your spouse or your sister Bertie without resorting to buzzwords—then my advice is simple: pass. There are no extra points in investing for degree of difficulty or for chasing the latest fad. Stick with what’s real, what you understand, and what has stood the test of time[^1][^2][^3].

And as always—never bet against America, or against common sense.
