<h1>From Algorithms to Actuarial Science</h1>


<p>Sam Castillo sat in the dimly lit corner of a coffee shop, the hum of conversation blending with the hiss of the espresso machine. He was hunched over his laptop, carefully crafting responses for a job application at a company regularly ranked among the best places to work. Sam’s path had been anything but straight—a story of ambition, detours, and an unrelenting drive to reach the actuarial world.</p>

<hr>

<p>An email notification broke his focus. Alena, a senior recruiter, had replied with a list of technical questions. The first one stared back at him: “Describe your reserving experience (lines of business, primary/reinsurance, etc.).”</p>

<p>Sam’s mind flashed to the startup he had poured years into. In a small, energetic office, he had built reserving models from real claims data—tackling coverage modifications, heavily skewed distributions, and catastrophic losses. He wrote Python and R from scratch, turning messy case studies into predictive tools that stood up to rigorous peer review.</p>

<p>He thought of his time at a leading insurance analytics firm, where he applied machine learning to enrich diagnostic data and forecast claim frequencies and severities—work that directly fed into reserve estimations. The nights were long, the cross-validation runs endless, but the results made every hour worthwhile.</p>

<p>His fingers moved quickly across the keys as he listed the commercial reserving platforms he had mastered: Curve GH, Arius, ResQ, Emblem, Radar. He described wrestling with Arius macros until they bent to his will, building deterministic and stochastic solutions that clients actually relied on.</p>

<p>At one of the Big Four professional services firms, he had blended traditional methods—chain ladder, Cape Cod, Bornhuetter-Ferguson—with machine-learning approaches to individual claim reserving. He also contributed to a SaaS loyalty product that required both deep technical skill and constant client collaboration.</p>

<p>Before that, he had built tax-reporting automation at a major online travel company and created web-scraping tools to pull property data across the EU. Every project, no matter the industry, had sharpened the same muscle: turning raw data into clarity.</p>

<hr>

<p>Alena soon scheduled a call. Sam prepared relentlessly. The interview felt strong. He followed up with gratitude, confidence, and a data-backed salary expectation. Then he waited.</p>

<p>Weeks passed. He kept delivering at his day job while refreshing his inbox. Finally, the phone rang.</p>

<p>“Hi Sam, it’s Alena… You impressed everyone with your skills and background. Unfortunately, after careful consideration, we’ve decided to move forward with a candidate who already holds actuarial credentials. We need someone who can immediately connect with our customer base on that level.”</p>

<p>The rejection stung—hard. Sam had always known credentials mattered, but hearing them named as the sole deciding factor felt like a door slamming shut.</p>

<p>He sat in silence for a long time, staring at the screen. Then something shifted. Heartbroken but not defeated, he pulled his study materials back onto the desk. If credentials were the last barrier, he would tear it down himself.</p>

<p>Late nights returned—this time not for work projects, but for probability distributions, life contingencies, and ratemaking theory. Every practice exam, every passed preliminary, brought him one step closer.</p>

<p>The dream had not ended; it had simply entered its hardest chapter. Sam Castillo reopened his books with renewed fire, certain that one day he would walk into the actuarial world not just qualified, but unstoppable.</p>

<p>His story was far from over.</p>
